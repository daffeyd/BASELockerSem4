# Smart Locker System with IoT for University (Touch to Borrow)
Entering 2023 BINUS ASO School of Engineering is switch into fully onsite activity, as BINUS ASO is provide a bunch of locker. But, the number of locker is far lower than the number of students, other than that the locker borrowing system was very complicated and takes a long time to complete. In order to solve the problem my team create a locker system that have a very short borrowing process and improve the effectiveness the system. Locker renting system has a recommendation system and returning time prediction with machine learning based on their history.
